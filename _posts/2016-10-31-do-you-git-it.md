Do you "git" it?

Is the [Git Reference Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) TL;DR?
<br>Or maybe the [cheat](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) [sheets](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) just look like gibberish.

Follow this [step-by-step guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) on how to "git" good!
