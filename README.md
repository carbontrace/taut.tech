# Welcome to Taut.tech

We are making a community for peer to peer learning from scratch!

[Join us on our slack](https://publicslack.com/slacks/taut-tech/invites/new) as we hack away!

We just set up our Github pages, using the [jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) tutorials.

We have our twitter and facebook page live too!

Let's learn!
